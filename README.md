### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ph.D. student studying with [Daniel R. Phillips](https://github.com/DanielRPhillips) at Ohio University. I am a member of the [BAND collaboration](https://github.com/bandframework) and I developed the Bayesian Model Mixing (BMM) package [Taweret](https://github.com/TaweretOrg/Taweret) with my fellow BAND and OSU collaborators. I work in the field of both creating and applying Bayesian Model Mixing methods to a wide variety of nuclear physics problems, performing crucial uncertainty quantification (UQ). Our most recent paper on applying Bayesian model mixing to the nuclear matter equation of state can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06323).

Some of my current and future research interests are:
- Bayesian Model Mixing/Uncertainty Quantification
- Equation of State (EOS) of dense matter/neutron stars
- Ab initio many-body methods
- Effective field theories (EFTs)
- Quantum Computing (and its application to nuclear physics and many-body methods)
